        <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Everand is a growing digital library app that features much more than
        just eBooks and audiobooks. Not everybody who uses a reading app does
        so with leisure. Oftentimes, users of these apps are students who are
        running on a deadline. <br /><br />Invisible disabilities are
        especially often overlooked when it comes to designing for
        accessibility. In this case study, I look at Attention Deficit
        Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) specifically--a neurodevelopmental
        disorder that affects 2.6% of adults worldwide--and find possible
        solutions to improve the user experience.</p>

          <h3>DISCOVER</h3>
          <h2>Constraint Mapping</h2>
        </div>
  <p>I began the Discover stage by doing a Constraint Mapping activity
    where I brainstormed permanent, situational, and temporary constraints
    that users of the app may have. These were adopted from <a href="https://inclusive.microsoft.design/">Microsoft's
      Inclusive Design</a> principles.</p>
      <p>After mapping various constraints which include physical disabilities such as vision and motor impairment, I decided to redesign for a mental constraint since most accessibility improvements already address physical impairments rather than mental. More specifically, I chose to focus on attention deficit. </p>

          <h2>KWHL Chart</h2>
        </div>
  <p>  Before developing solutions, I needed to gain a deeper understanding
    of ADHD and how this demographic interacts with technology and
    reading. I filled out the first three components of a KWHL chart (What I know, need to find, and how I'll be getting the information) to
    help me get started. </p>

    <p>I had to learn about the general, app-specific, and reading-specific challenges ADHD users face. In addition to this, I wanted to find out about accessibiity features that could be helpful to them. I decided to collect information through a user interview, observation, and secondary research sources. </p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
        </div>
  <p> An individual with diagnosed ADHD was recruited to participate in a
    semi-structured interview. I asked questions regarding their general
    experience living with ADHD. This was followed by an exploration of
    the Everand app and a ten minute task to read the first chapter of a
    novel of their choice. Afterwards, questions were asked about the
    experience they just had with the app. Below is an anonymized summary
    of the interview's key points. </p>

            Scholarly articles related to ADHD, reading, and acessibility were

            findings are as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Individuals with attention deficit have poor reading comprehension when reading digitally which is correlated to their decreased sustained attention (Ben-Yehudah and Brann; Stern et al.). </li><br>
            <li>
              Text-to-speech may assist people with ADHD understand what they are reading more clearly and have less problems with reading in general (Kyriakaki and Driga 207). 
            </li><br>
            <li>Reading aids such as reading guides and highlights help people with ADHD concentrate on one line of text at a time, minimizing visual distractions and improving reading comprehension and tracking (Kyriakaki and Driga 207). </li><br>
            <li>Apps that use strategies including gamification, interactive activities, and audiovisual stimulation provide an organized and encouraging environment for people with ADHD to develop they attention skills by including elements like progress tracking and incentives (Kyriakaki and Driga 208). </li>

      <p> Using data from all research sources about ADHD, I developed three personas to capture each type of contstraint (permanent, temporary, and situational) centered around attention deficit. Each persona can be viewed by using the dot indicator below.</p>

      <p> Analyzing research and creating personas allowed me to develop a possible solution to solving the usersâ€™ mismatched interaction. </p>
      <p>A venn diagram including all of the possible solutions gathered from each source of research is created. Here, I can hone in on which features are more necessary which have been highlighted in yellow. Although the tutorial was only mentioned on one side, I felt that it should be considered since it increases user-friendliness. According to an NNGroup article, icons weren't sufficient in letting users know what features were available and therefore a tutorial may be a good idea to implement. </p>

      <p> Mental disabilities shouldn't be considered less important just because we can't see them. We as designers must consider all possible usability challenges ours users face. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of users with ADHD by working closely with one. This way, I was able to become empathetic with their personal experiences. This project reinforced the importance of research and working with users to reach a solution. Without doing the preliminary research, my solutions would have been totally different.  </p>
