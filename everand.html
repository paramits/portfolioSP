          Everand is a growing digital library app that features much more than
          just eBooks and audiobooks. Not everybody who uses a reading app does
          so with leisure. Oftentimes, users of these apps are students who are
          running on a deadline. <br /><br />Invisible disabilities are
          especially often overlooked when it comes to designing for
          accessibility. In this case study, I look at Attention Deficit
          Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) specifically--a neurodevelopmental
          disorder that affects 2.6% of adults worldwide--and find possible
          solutions to improve the user experience.

          Many accessibility improvements address physical constraints.
          Therefore, I decided to solve for a mental constraint instead.

          benefits everyone, so I used users with ADHD as a baseline for my
          research.

          An individual with diagnosed ADHD was recruited to participate in a
          semi-structured interview. I asked questions regarding their general
          experience living with ADHD. This was followed by an exploration of
          the Everand app and a ten minute task to read the first chapter of a
          novel of their choice. Afterwards, questions were asked about the
          experience they just had with the app. Below is an anonymized summary
          of the interview's key points.

                navigate? <br>
                <strong id="participant">Participant:</strong> Uh, I mean it's easy enough to navigate, but I feel like it's because I've used other apps. But 
                I guess most people have used other apps. Some stuff's weird though, like, the spacing and no numbers 
                to tell me what my font size is. <br>
                <strong id="participant">Participant:</strong> It doesn't teach you, right? There's no, like tutorial. I guess apps don't need a tutorial, but 
                there's nothing, like, flashing going: "This button does this." Like, I had to look for things myself. <br>

                Considering your ADHD or any difficulties you encountered. <br>
                <strong id="participant">Participant:</strong> Hm, it's hard to know what you'd need until you've seen it and I'm not sure what would help. I can't 
                really think of anything the app could do unless it, like, gives you XP (experience points) for clicking words or 
                highlight. <br>
                <strong>Interviewer:</strong> Oh, like a completion thing? <br>
                <strong id="participant">Participant:</strong> Yeah, yeah, that would probably work. Like, I don't know you get, like, an achievement for reading a 
                book. I'm not competitive though, so it wouldn't really help me to be like "Oh, I got more book challenges done."</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="paragraph insightText">More Suggestions</h3>
                <p><strong id="participant">Participant:</strong> It's such a hard question because I don't know. I don't know. What if it highlighted as I read? Oh yeah, 
                  so if you were interacted with it more, then that'd probably help, right? [Explain?] So, like, you click a line as you've 
                  read it and then it highlights it. So you feel like you're getting-completing things. Like a checklist of book lines. That'd 
                  probably help especially if you like checklists. <br>
                  <strong>Interviewer:</strong> So would you like the highlights to be visible all the time or the checklist is something that you open 
                  and close? <br>
                  <strong id="participant">Participant:</strong> Nooo, you'd want it all the time. Well, you're not gonna re-read any lines. Plus, it might help you 
                  remember: "I read this line, then check." Plus, you'd pay more attention then 'cause you'd be checking off as you go. 
                  There has to be an app for checklist for pages, right? There's no way someone hasn't done that. <br>
                  <strong>Interviewer:</strong> I actually don't think so--wait, so you think a checklist for pages would be good enough as opposed to 
                  a checklist for lines? <br>
                  <strong id="participant">Participant:</strong> I'd do it for lines, but.. I mean, okay, how about it's lines, but you go back to the main menu and then it 
                  has ticks next to each chapter or page that you've read. You know what I mean? Then you'd feel like accomplished, 
                  right? Like Duolingo, right?

          A venn diagram including all of the possible solutions gathered from

          features are more necessary which have been highlighted in yellow.
          Although the tutorial was only mentioned on one side, I felt that it
          should be considered since it increases user-friendliness. According
          to an NNGroup article, icons weren't sufficient in letting users know
          what features were available and therefore a tutorial may be a good
          idea to implement.

          Mental disabilities shouldn't be considered less important just
          because we can't see them. We as designers must consider all possible
          usability challenges ours users face. Through this project, I gained a
          better understanding of users with ADHD by working closely with one. This way, I was able to become empathetic with their personal experiences. This project reinforced the importance of research and working with users to reach a solution. Without doing the preliminary research, my solutions would have been totally different.
