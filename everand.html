        <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Everand is a digital library app that provides eBooks, audiobooks, and more. At the time of this project, <strong>Everand lacked accessibility features</strong>, potentially alienating users from productivity. Within this case study, I look at Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) specifically.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="genHead">Why did I choose to focus on ADHD?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://inclusive.microsoft.design/">Microsoft's Inclusive Design</a> methodology believes in the notion of "Solve for One, extend to many." <span id="emText">Invisible disabilities</span> are especially often overlooked when it comes to designing for accessibility. By designing for ADHD which affects 2.6% of adults worldwide, I hope to open up accessibility to a wide range of users.</p>

        </div>
  <p>I began the Discover stage by doing a Constraint Mapping activity
    where I brainstormed permanent, situational, and temporary constraints
    that users of the app with ADHD may have. These were also adopted from <a href="https://inclusive.microsoft.design/">Microsoft's
      Inclusive Design</a> principles and would later help with persona development.</p>

            Scholarly articles related to ADHD, reading, and acessibility were

          <ul>
            <li>Individuals with attention deficit have  <mark class="highlight-discover">poor reading comprehension when reading digitally</mark> which is correlated to their decreased sustained attention (Ben-Yehudah and Brann; Stern et al.). </li><br>

              <mark class="highlight-discover">Text-to-speech</mark> may assist people with ADHD understand what they are reading more clearly and have less problems with reading in general (Kyriakaki and Driga 207). 
            </li><br>
            <li>Reading aids such as <mark class="highlight-discover">reading guides and highlights</mark> help people with ADHD concentrate on one line of text at a time, <mark class="highlight-discover">minimizing visual distractions</mark> and improving reading comprehension and tracking (Kyriakaki and Driga 207). </li><br>
            <li>Apps that use strategies including <mark class="highlight-discover">gamification, interactive activities, and audiovisual stimulation</mark> provide an organized and encouraging environment for people with ADHD to develop they attention skills by including elements like <mark class="highlight-discover">progress tracking and incentives</mark> (Kyriakaki and Driga 208). </li>

              <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
            </div>
      <p> Analyzing research and creating personas allowed me to develop a possible solution to solve the users’ mismatched interaction. </p>
      <p>A venn diagram including all of the possible solutions gathered from each source of research was created. Here, I can hone in on which features are more necessary. Although the tutorial was only mentioned on one side, I felt that it should be considered since it increases user-friendliness. According to an NNGroup article, icons weren't sufficient in letting users know what features were available and therefore a tutorial may be a good idea to implement. </p>

              <h2>Reflection: Designing <em>with</em>, not just <em>for</em> users</h2>
            </div>
      <p> Invisible disabilities shouldn't be considered less important just because we can't see them. This project reinforced the importance of preliminary research and working with users to reach a solution. As designers, we must consider all possible usability challenges our users face. I was fortunately able to gain a better understanding of users with ADHD by working closely with one which gave me insights that I would have never considered on my own.  Each user's experiences are unique and each interaction gives us a new perspective to consider when designing.  </p>
