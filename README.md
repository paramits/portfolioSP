# Static HTML/CSS/JS Workspace  
## Welcome  
You are running an instance of the Static HTML/CSS/JS Coder workspace for IXD students at Sheridan College. Each instance of the workspace is precongifured with boilerplate files (e.g. index.html). You are encouraged to adapt it for your own use case. 
## Editor
The online editor is a [browser-based version of VSCode](https://github.com/coder/code-server). Your workspace will keep running even if you close this window. You may share access to this editor (see the Share options below) but a Sheridan login is required.
## Workspace 
The Coder Workspace page ([https://ixdcoder.com/@paramith/portfolioresponsive](https://ixdcoder.com/@paramith/portfolioresponsive)) gives you settings and workflow options. You can setup a schedule for the workspace (e.g. run continuously or go to sleep after a while). Be sure to check out all the options on the [workspace page](https://ixdcoder.com/@paramith/portfolioresponsive) under **Settings** > **Workspace Schedule** > **Autostop**.
## Publishing
Your project will be reachable at the following Public URL:
[https://public--main--portfolioresponsive--paramith.ixdcoder.com/](https://public--main--portfolioresponsive--paramith.ixdcoder.com/). You can share this with anyone who wants to see your work. 
## Shortcuts
On the bottom left toolbar, you will find some useful shortcuts:
- üåê Share: Opens a panel to give you options for sharing access to your project. 
- üìÇ Zip: Shortcut to automatically create a ZIP Archive of the Project and download it. 
- üñ•Ô∏è Terminal: Opens the Terminal window if it is not already open.
## Live Server 
The Static HTML/CSS/JS Workspace makes use of [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) package under the hood. Live Server runs automatically behind the scenes as soon as the workspace is started. 
## IXD Tools
This workspace includes some extra buttons and features that have been added via a custom VSCode extension [IXD Tools](https://bender.sheridanc.on.ca/sikkemha/ixd-tools) created by [Harold Sikkema](https://nsitu.ca). If you have questions or concerns about this extension please contact [harold.sikkema@sheridancollege.ca](harold.sikkema@sheridancollege.ca)
