        <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>As people’s interest in the digital world grew since its introduction, there have been many innovations that bridged the physical and digital world. Virtual pets are one of many gamified examples of this. Either through a handheld device or on the internet, they allow players to interact with a digital creature behind a screen and take care of it as if it were a real pet.<br><br>

        This project takes inspiration from many existing virtual pets in its technical, conceptual, and aesthetic design. The concept of integrated systems also plays a part in the final design. Using the Makey Makey and P5.js, both touch and sound are interconnected to create system where the physical “real” world flows into digital and vice-versa for specific elements of the design.<br><br>
        
        Accessibility is also factored in since this is a product meant for younger children. The interface of the physical component is designed in a way that matches a young child’s cognitive capabilities with its distinct shapes and labels. Feedback for doing an action successfully is given in the form of a visual change on the screen and/or sound. Overall, the combination of touch, sound, and visuals allows for a more immersive experience. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>This project started with a simple goal: to make an integrated system using the Makey-Makey and P5.js library. Along the way, I decided that I wanted my final product to be geared towards children's entertainment. I immediately thought about virtual pets which played a large role in my childhood. Therefore, a <em>How Might I</em> statement was created to get the ball rolling.</p>

        <!-- <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Research was broken up into three categories: Technical, Conceptual, and Design.</p>
        <div class="infoText" id="subtitle">
        <div class="sectionTitle">
          <h2>Technical</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Technical research consisted of looking at existing Makey Makey projects (websites, videos) in order to see what the device was capable of. This research was done mostly during the early weeks in order to help generate main concept ideas and additional ideas for what certain inputs could become.
<br><br>
          Research was also done for the p5.js coding since I needed a refresher and there were some new things I wanted to implement—namely, the classes and the animation cycles. This research consisted mostly of going through existing p5.js sketches posted online and studing their code. It was important to understand how the code worked so I could implement it with my own design.</p> -->
      </div>
      <!-- <div class="infoText" id="subtitle">
        <div class="sectionTitle">
          <h2>Conceptual</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          A large part of conceptual research done was related to <strong>accessibility</strong>. The main audience for this product would be young children, perhaps as young as five. I looked at children’s toys to gain a sense of what children were cognitively capable of in order to make my product accessible. 
<br><br>
I found that children’s toys with multiple parts had distinct shapes for each part so the child would know where they were supposed to go. Additionally, many toys for this age group reflect real life occupations (cashier, cook, doctor, etc.). At this age, children have a sense of object affordances which allows them to decipher what each component of of the toy does and where they should go. For example, the crevice on the side of the cash register affords thin objects to slide through it. Although the card, cash, and coins are thin enough to slide through it, the child possibly knows to use the card instead due to their prior experience of watching their parents do so. Furthermore, a research article states that children as young as 4 have the capability to recognize symbols/icon and associate them with their correct meaning.
<br><br>
In terms of an <strong>integrated system</strong>, I had intended the physical component of my project to act exactly like a gaming controller. The biggest difference is that the controller would be much more immersive. Just like occupation-reflecting toys, each action would reflect a real-life action while its respective sound would play: feeding the pet, rubbing the pet’s belly, sweeping waste from the floor, and pressing down a light switch.
        </p>
      </div> -->
      <!-- <div class="infoText" id="subtitle">
        <div class="sectionTitle">
          <h2>Design</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Most of the design research came from comparing existing virtual pet user interfaces. I looked at what gameplay elements were most used which led me to focus on hunger, love/affection, and energy levels. Additionally, the gameplay mechanic of cleaning the pet’s waste came from Tamagotchi and Pou just to add another level of interactivity. Pou also inspired the art direction of the p5.js look with its simple line-art and solid bright colours. 
<br><br>
Research related to the design of the project’s physical component was done in conjunction with the conceptual research since they go hand-in-hand. Other than the research from the previous page, I thought of other ways in which the Makey Makey could be hidden. Eventually, I remembered the Nintendo Labo which constructs many different types of housing for the Nintendo Switch using cardboard. I would end up doing something similar, keeping the room concept and create a house-like structure whose construction was inspired by a building from Apex Legends.

  <p>I began the Discover stage by doing a Constraint Mapping activity

      Inclusive Design</a> principles.</p>
      <p>After mapping various constraints which include physical disabilities such as vision and motor impairment, I decided to redesign for a mental constraint since most accessibility improvements already address physical impairments rather than mental. More specifically, I chose to focus on attention deficit. </p>

    help me get started. </p>

    <p>I had to learn about the general, app-specific, and reading-specific challenges ADHD users face.

      <p> Mental disabilities shouldn't be considered less important just because we can't see them. We as designers must consider all possible usability challenges ours users face. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of users with ADHD by working closely with one. This way, I was able to become empathetic with their personal experiences. This project reinforced the importance of research and working with users to reach a solution. Without doing the preliminary research, my solutions would have been totally different.  </p>
