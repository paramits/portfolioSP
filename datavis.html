      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project was to design and publish an interactive data visualization that adds value to a
        speculative product or service. I decided to blend topics I had interest in: sustainability, children’s
        education, and game development.</p>

      <h2>Cool the Earth!</h2>
      <p>I designed a mockup of a game for an educational children’s gaming app that would feature a collection of
        mini-games. <em><strong>Cool the Earth</strong></em>, teaches kids how different countries contribute to
        greenhouse gas emissions by amount and sector. Through hands-on, interactive play, children can learn how
        greenhouse gases impact global warming. </p>

      <h2>Who are Our Users?</h2>
      <p>To start designing my speculative product, I first defined my target audience. Doing this gave me a starting
        point for future design decisions based on user needs determined by factors like their cognitive level and
        visual preferences.</p>
      <img src="imgs/targetaudience_datavis.svg">
      <p>A persona and user journey map was also created to ground my design decisions.</p>

      <h2>Working with the Data</h2>
      <p>I chose to use green house gas emissions data from <strong>Our World in Data</strong> for my data source. The
        first thing I
        needed to do was narrow down and clean the massive dataset. With the data prepared for each country’s emissions
        to be visualized, I was ready to start designing.</p>

      <h2>Designing for Kids</h2>
      <h3>What Makes a "Children's Game"?</h3>
      <p>I did a Competitor Analysis gained an understanding of existing experiences and design patterns which helped me
        later on when I was developing my own assets. I noted down their user flow, how each taught through
        gamification, as well as their visual branding. </p>
      <img src="imgs/competitiveAnalysis.png">

      <p>Elements that I found to be important to children’s games include:</p>
      <img src="imgs/gameInsights.svg">
      <br>
      <h3>Game Concepts</h3>
      <h4 id="coolTheEarth">BRICK BREAKER</h4>
      <div class="threeImg">
        <img src="imgs/brickbreaker1.png">
        <img src="imgs/brickbreaker2.png">
        <img src="imgs/brickbreaker3.png">
      </div>
      <p>I based the mini-game on a Brick Breaker–style mechanic to visually and interactively represent how greenhouse
        gases trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere. Inspired by educational videos that used reflection and deflection
        metaphors, the ball represents heat attempting to escape, while the number of bricks scales with a country’s
        greenhouse gas emissions. This mechanic allows children to physically feel how increased emissions make it
        harder for heat to escape, reinforcing the concept through play.</p>
      <div class="twoCol">
        <img src="imgs/brickbreakerGif.gif">
        <p>To the left is a video of a basic prototype I made using Godot engine that captures the functionality of
          Brick Breaker. However, this game concept was later scrapped after a feedback session where it was brought to
          my attention that the way I was presenting my data was potentially misleading.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4 id="coolTheEarth">WINGO BALL</h4>
      <div class="threeImg">
        <img src="imgs/wingoball1.png">
        <img src="imgs/wingoball2.png">
        <img src="imgs/wingoball3.png">
      </div>
      <p>The chosen iteration was inspired by the flash game Wingoball which focuses on navigating a ball through
        obstacles to reach a safe zone. In this concept, the ball represents heat escaping Earth’s atmosphere, while the
        size of the obstacles is equal to a country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Instead of emphasizing quantity, this
        approach communicates impact through scale, allowing children to experience how higher emissions make it more
        difficult for heat to escape.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Visual Assets</h3>
      <h4 id="coolTheEarth">GREENHOUSE GASSES</h4>
      <p>Inspired by a Futurama episode that personified greenhouse gases and children's books, I explored
        personaification to make abstract concepts more understandable for children.</p>

      <div class="twoColImg">
        <div class="twoColImgTwo">
          <img src="imgs/visualAssetsGas2.png">
          <img src="imgs/visualAssetsGas3.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="twoColImgOne">
          <img src="imgs/visualAssetsGas1.png">
        </div>
      </div>

      <br>
      <br>
      <h4 id="coolTheEarth">USER INTERFACE</h4>
      <p>I took the observations I had while exploring each children’s app, used it as inspiration, and translated that
        into my own app’s design.</p>
      <div class="twoCol">
        <img src="imgs/UI_dataVis1.png">
        <p>My first iteration was very flat and simple. Inspiration was drawn from <strong>Khan Academy Kids’</strong>
          UI that does a great job at looking playful and inviting which appeals to children</p>
      </div>
      <img src="imgs/UI_dataVis.png">
    </div>
    <div class="infoText">
      <h2>Putting it Together</h2>
      <div class="twoCol">
        <p>In order to accurately represent the data, bubble charts were created in Tableau. This allowed me to get a
          meaningful scale of the data. The green house gas graphics were then resized to match their respective bubble.
        </p>
        <img src="imgs/drawingdataVis2.png">
      </div>
      <p>For the purpose of creating a mockup, the game was entirely animated using Adobe After Effects. Everything was
        later put together in Figma along with the lesson portion of the product.</p>

      <h2>Reflection: Designing Data for Young Minds</h2>
      <p>My goal was to integrate a data visualization into a product while designing for children. This required meant
        that I had to simplify complex data without misrepresenting its meaning. Throughout the project, I constantly
        asked myself, "Could a child understand this?" Balancing accuracy with accessibility became a central design
        challenge and ultimately shaped many of my decisions. <br><br>If I were to continue building out this project, I
        would conduct usability testing with real users to evaluate understanding, engagement, and potential pain
        points, then iterate based on those findings. </p>
